## General Information

Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. CNN based model shall be built which can accurately detect melanoma.

## Technologies Used
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SKLearn
- Tensor flow
- Glob

## Conclusions
- There is a significant amount of class imbalance in the dataset. To rectify data imbalance data augmentation techniques were applied. 
  It helped to increase the accuracy of the model.
  Additing drop out layers helped to reduce overfitting of the model.
  In the final model training accuracy is 94.72% and validation accuracy is 80.79%.
  Hence model accuracy has significantly improved , Class imbalance and Overfitting is reduced.
